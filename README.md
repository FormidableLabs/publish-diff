Publish Diff
============

View diffs of what you _will_ publish to `npm` **before** you really do!

Publishing a package from a local repository runs the risk of last minute
human mistakes like:

- deletions
- mutations
- additions

to the files sent to the `npm` registry.

`publish-diff` offers the piece of mind that you will publish exactly what you
intend to publish with convenient, **git-style diffs** against the `npm`
registry from your local project.

### Maintenance Status: Stable

Formidable is not planning to develop any new features for this project. We are still responding to bug reports and security concerns. We are still welcoming PRs for this project, but PRs that include new features should be small and easy to integrate and should not include breaking changes.

## Installation

Install this package as a global dependency.

```sh
$ npm install -g publish-diff
```

## Usage

The basics:


```
  Usage: publish-diff [options]

  Preview npm publish changes.


  Options:

    -V, --version              output the version number
    -o, --old <package>        Old package to diff (default `<package>@latest`)
    -n, --new <package>        New package to diff (default `process.cwd()`)
    -r, --registry <registry>  The npm registry to diff the package against
    -f, --filter <pattern>     File glob patterns to filter to
    --no-colors                Disable colors in the outputted diff
    -h, --help                 output usage information

  Examples:

    # Compare (old) npm registry `latest` version vs. (new) local `process.cwd()`
    $ publish-diff

    # Compare (old) npm version vs. (new) latest npm version
    $ publish-diff -o rowdy@0.4.0 -n rowdy@latest

    # Compare (old) git tag/hash vs. (new) git tag/hash
    $ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.4.0 -n FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.5.0

    # Filter differences to only lib and src directories
    $ publish-diff -o radium@0.21.1 -n radium@0.21.2 --filter='{lib,src}/**'

    # Filter differences to ignore dist directory
    $ publish-diff -o radium@0.21.1 -n radium@0.21.2 --filter='!dist/**'
```

### Local Diffs

The most common case is to compare the `latest` published version of a
package (old) against the current working directory (new). In this case,
`publish-diff` will infer the package's `name` from the `package.json` file.

```sh
$ publish-diff
```

The script takes `-o|--old` and `-n|--new` values to determine what to diff.

* `-n|--new`: Defaults to current working directory (`process.cwd()`) in the
  local filesystem. This assumes the common case of publishing a new version
  from your machine.
* `-o|--old`: Defaults to the `package.json:name` of the package extracted from
  the `--new` argument at its latest version in the `npm` registry.

For a package `<pkg>` already published to the `npm` registry the default case
expands to:

```sh
$ publish-diff -o <local cwd> -n <latest npm version>

# Diff local version vs latest on npm registry
$ publish-diff
$ publish-diff -n .
$ publish-diff -o <pkg>@latest -n .
$ publish-diff -o <pkg>@latest

# Diff local version vs tag or old version
$ publish-diff -o <pkg>@beta
$ publish-diff -o <pkg>@1.2.3

# Diff local version vs other local version
$ publish-diff -o /path/to/some-version
$ publish-diff -o /path/to/some-version -n .
$ publish-diff -o /path/to/some-version -n /path/to/other-version
```

### Remote Diffs

Under the hood, `publish-diff` relies on the amazingly flexible
[`npm pack`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/pack) to create the "real deal" version
of a package that is already / will be published. This also gives us some extra
flexibility in specifying the old and new packages to compare against as
`publish-diff` permits passing the `-o` and `-n` arguments with any value that
would otherwise be permissible to `npm pack`.

This means you can view remote differences across already published versions of
packages without needing a local checkout:

```sh
$ publish-diff -n <npm name + version>
$ publish-diff -o <npm name + version> -n <npm name + version>

# Diff old version vs. latest on npm registry
$ publish-diff -o rowdy@0.4.0   -n rowdy@latest
$ publish-diff -o radium@0.17.2 -n radium

# Diff two old versions on npm registry
$ publish-diff -o rowdy@0.4.0   -n rowdy@0.5.0
$ publish-diff -o radium@0.17.2 -n radium@0.18.0
```

And you can do the same with git versions:

```sh
# Diff git tag/hash vs latest on npm registry
$ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.4.0  -n rowdy
$ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#504735c -n rowdy@latest
$ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.4.0  -n rowdy@latest

# Diff two old versions from git tag/hash
$ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.4.0  -n FormidableLabs/rowdy#v0.5.0
$ publish-diff -o FormidableLabs/rowdy#504735c -n FormidableLabs/rowdy#fe25a22
```

Note that when doing local / git-based comparisons that portions of the `npm`
publish / version lifecycles may be missing and you may need to manually
approximate this (discussed in detail in the next section).

### npm Lifecycle Complexities

One complexity that comes up frequently is `npm` lifecycle events that occur
in publishing that need to be simulated to accurately generate a preview diff.
Specifically, if the following taks is present in a `package.json` file, it
will occur before actual publishing:

- `prepublish`

After publishing, the following tasks run if found:

- `publish`
- `postpublish`

If a project uses an `npm version` workflow to control versioning of git source
it will invoke the following `package.json` tasks if found:

- `preversion`
- `version`

After versioning, the following task is run if found:

- `postversion`

Translating this to `publish-diff`, if you want to simulate what will actually
be published, a more accurate command line sequence would be:

```sh
$ npm run prepublish && \
  publish-diff && \
  npm run postpublish
```

The gotcha here is that if there is a `package.json:publish` script it would
not be run and you will need to manually approximate that because running
`npm run publish` would **actually publish**, defeating the point of previewing
your diff.

For a `version` workflow, an appropriate command line sequence may look
something like:

```sh
$ npm run preversion && \
  publish-diff && \
  npm run postversion
```

Similar to `publish`, you would not want to run `npm run version` because it
has side effects -- in this case, mutating the git state of your project.
Projects with an actual `package.json:version` script would need manual cleanup.

## Notes

### `.npmrc` Files

`publish-diff` follows the `npm` rules for searching for `.npmrc` files --
https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc#files -- which approximates to:

- `${process.cwd()}/.npmrc`
- `~/.npmrc`
- `$NODE_GLOBAL_PATH/etc/npmrc`
- `$SYSTEM_PATH/npm/npmrc`

`publish-diff` shells to `npm pack` which will out-of-the-box work with all but
the first of these rc file locations. The complexity is that for the actual
`npm pack` command, `publish-diff` creates and switches to a temporary
directory. To compensate for this behavior, if a `${process.cwd()}/.npmrc` file
is found, that is _also_ copied to the temporary directory before initiating
any underlying `npm` commands.
